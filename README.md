## React Scrabble
Hello! Welcome to React Scrabble, a personal project I'm developing.
- React Scrabble uses React, TypeScript, and SCSS.
- Later on, I'll probably try to incorporate Redux as well.

#### What is in scope for this project?
- A feature-rich React UI allowing the user to play Scrabble against an AI
- An AI that is functional to play against, and actually does AI-like things like calculating all possible moves and picking the best one

#### What is NOT in scope for this project?
- Investing too much time into the AI portion. Scrabble AI is not a solved problem in computer science. There is a great deal of literature online about the topic, and I don't have the time or the talent to contribute much in that area.
- CSS Animations. I'd rather focus on React functionality, AI functionality, and some basic styling.
- Backend. Seems a bit out of scope for a Scrabble Game. 

#### So, why am I making this app?
1. I want to get better at TypeScript
2. The project seems really interesting, particularly doing it from scratch, as opposed to using someone else's pre-existing scrabble library
3. I need to brush off the dust


## Available Scripts
